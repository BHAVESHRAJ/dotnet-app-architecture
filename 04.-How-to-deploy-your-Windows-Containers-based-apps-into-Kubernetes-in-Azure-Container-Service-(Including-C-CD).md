# Deploying eShopModernizedMVC to Kubernetes

## Overview
Applications based on Windows Containers will soon need to use platforms going further from IaaS VMs in order to easily achieve a better automated scalability, high scalability and significant improvement in automated deployments and versioning. You can achieve those goals with the orchestrator Kubernetes, available in Azure Container Services.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This post describes how to deploy eShopModernizedMVC to Kubernetes but deploying the eShopModernizedWebForms should be pretty similar, so you can use almost the same procedure but using different deployment .yml files.
 
Deploying to Kubernetes (K8s), from scratch, is a 2-step process:
- Deploy a K8s cluster in Azure Container Service (Azure) or any other environment.
- Deploy the application and related resources into the K8s cluster

However, before trying this scenario deploying to an orchestrator, it is recommended that you:
1. Familiarize yourself with the previous sections about containerizing existing .NET Framework apps.
2. You’ve been testing the sample applications (eShopModernizedMVC and/or eShopModernizedWebForms) and running them on a local Docker for Windows dev machine.

##  Scenarios

### Scenario A: Direct deployment to K8s cluster from dev environment
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30443383-264dd546-9934-11e7-8c86-6d0c892927bb.png)

### Scenario B: Deployment to K8s cluster from CI/CD pipelines in VSTS

TBD

## Prerequisites
- Azure Subscription
- Azure CLI installed on dev machine (explained below)
- Kubectl (Kubernetes CLI) installed on dev machine
- Access to eShopModernizedMVC image at Docker Hub (or any other Docker Registry)

## Position PowerShell into the eShopModernizedMVC-K8s\ServiceDeployments folder
Clone the Repo code into your hard drive.
Open a PowerShell with Admin privileges and run:
   `cd C:\Your-Path-to-eShopModernizing\Kubernetes\eShopModernizedMVC-K8s\ServiceDeployments`

## Connect to Azure from Azure CLI (PowerShell or Bash)
1. Run **Azure CLI**: In order to run the Azure CLI locally, (you need Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later) you need to install it if you don't have it. Follow this procedure: [Install Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    
    Then, check the version:

    `az --version` 

1. **Login to Azure** with:

   `az login`

2. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you whish to work with:

   `az account set --subscription [my-azure-subscription-guid]`

3. Check your default subscription with:

   `az account show`

## Deploying the Kubernetes Cluster in Azure Container Service (ACS)

In order to deploy Windows Containers we need a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes instead of Linux. 
However, the Master node will be a Linux node.

Yo can find additional generic info on Kubernetes deployment into ACS in this post:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/kubernetes/container-service-kubernetes-windows-walkthrough

1. **Create an Azure Resource Group** to hold everything related to the Kubernetes cluster and delete everything in a single step whenever you need to. Of course, you can choose your own name for the Resource Group: 

   `az group create --name eShopK8sWinResGrp --location westus`

2. **Create the Kubernetes cluster** (you should use your own cluster name, user name and password):

   `az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group eShopK8sWinResGrp --name=eShopK8sWinCluster --agent-count=2 --generate-ssh-keys --windows --admin-username youruser --admin-password your@password`

   If re-using already an created ssh key pair, you can add a pointer to the public key, something like the following:

   `--ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/eshop_rsa.pub`

3. **Install kubectl** if you don't have it installed in your PC
   To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your client computer, use kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line client.

   If you're using Azure CloudShell, kubectl is already installed. 

   If you want to install it locally, you can use the az acs kubernetes install-cli command.
   The following Azure CLI example installs kubectl to your system. 
   On Windows, run this command as an administrator:

   `az acs kubernetes install-cli`

4. **Connect to the Kubernetes cluster** and set the ssh key files to your local PC

   `az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=eShopK8sWinResGrp --name=eShopK8sWinCluster`

   Again, if re-using an already created ssh key pair, you can add a pointer to the private key, like the following:

   `--ssh-key-file C:\Users\CESARDL\.ssh\eshop_rsa`

5. **Check the connection with kubectl** connecting to the cluster by retrieving nodes list: 

   `kubectl get nodes`
   ![kubectl-get-nodes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30344662-1301075c-97b7-11e7-93c4-aa7f8c7cc251.png)

6. Open the Kubernetes Dashboard to check what’s going on in the cluster using a browser.
    - Open another PowerShell and run this command:

    `kubectl proxy`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30345183-088e05e8-97b9-11e7-85f6-9087108e61d2.png)
    - Now, open a browser and type the following to Connect to Kubernetes Dashboard:

    `http://localhost:8001/ui`
     
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30345114-d232ae04-97b8-11e7-9b33-fe7345ef6975.png)
     Leave it open so that you can check there, changes applied later.
   
## Deploying the eShopModernizedMVC app into the Kubernetes Cluster
1. In case you are positioned in a different place, make sure you move, in PowerShell, to your deployment file path:

   `cd C:\Your-Path-to-eShopModernizing\Kubernetes\eShopModernizedMVC-K8s\ServiceDeployments`

2. Use or create a similar deployment file than this: [eshop-modernized-mvc-k8s-services-deployment.yml](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/blob/master/Kubernetes/eShopModernizedMVC-K8s/ServiceDeployments/eshop-modernized-mvc-k8s-services-deployment.yml)

3. Run in PowerShell within the path `C:\Your-Path-to-eShopModernizing\Kubernetes\eShopModernizedMVC-K8s\ServiceDeployments`
 
    `kubectl create -f eshop-modernized-mvc-k8s-services-deployment.yml`

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30345811-6cf101f0-97bb-11e7-8e12-f97d9e3870c5.png)

4. Check it out from Kubectl CLI:

    `kubectl get pods`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30345958-02a94b62-97bc-11e7-8bba-c1da60856594.png)

    `kubectl get svc`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30345982-160b1e4c-97bc-11e7-8471-a86935dbc91d.png)

    You'll need to wait until you have an IP assigned. Check again until you see the IP with:

    `kubectl get svc`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346010-27ef0ac4-97bc-11e7-90d2-d402c3b4dbe1.png)

5. Run eShopModernizedMVC from Kubernetes!
    **IMPORTANT**: The first time you might need to wait a few minutes until the SQL Server Docker image is pulled.

    You can check how the deployment is going by taking a look to the Kubernetes dashboard, like in the following screenshot where you can see how the containers are still being deployed (You need to set the `kubectl proxy` first):

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30572704-3280de9e-9ca4-11e7-8527-b4d45f4acdf6.png)

    You can also check the state of the deployment by typing `kubectl get services` where you'll see the EXTERNAL IP to use and ports to use when the deployment is finished.

    So, finally, you can test the app by typing the IP you get like in the following case:

    `http://104.42.224.204/`

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346103-8433e4ee-97bc-11e7-83f2-3345b383c9cf.png)

## Scale-out the eShopModernizedMVC container/deployment to multiple containers

1. To scale-out the eShopModernizedMVC container/deployment run the following command with Kubectl:

    `kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployments/eshop-modernized-mvc`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346438-935badd4-97bd-11e7-866d-667877dfe30f.png)

2. To see in the CLI the number of replicas per deployment, run:

    `kubectl get deployments`
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346477-ae668b76-97bd-11e7-95f1-459eda578ba1.png)

3. You can also scale-out the eShopModernizedMVC container/deployment from the Kubernetes Web UI:
     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346486-bba0075e-97bd-11e7-9d77-84175cd23673.png)

5. To see in the Kubernetes Web UI the number of replicas per deployment:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/30346506-cb351db2-97bd-11e7-90f6-9c8196c93acc.png)


You can delete everything from Azure with a simple Azure CLI 2 command: 

`az group delete --name eShopK8sWinResGrp --yes --no-wait`

Or using the Azure portal, of course.
