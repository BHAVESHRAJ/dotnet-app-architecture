As a traditional business, it's possible that you first wrote your WinForms application on a low resolution monitor. Now that you've invested in the latest 4K monitors, you want your application to look just as nice and function properly without having to do any redesign. Luckily, by making a couple edits to your application you'll be able to do this in just a few minutes.

NOTE: Make sure that your WinForms app is targeting .NET Framework 4.7 or above, otherwise the improvements will not work.

Follow the two simple instructions below to enable High DPI compatibility in your app.

# Add and Change the App Manifest
First you'll need to add an app manifest to your WinForms project. To do this you'll want to right click on your project -> Add -> Application Manifest.

Then declare compatibility with Windows 10 by adding the following in your manifest:

```<compatibility xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft.comn:compatibility.v1">
  <application>
    <!-- Windows 10 compatibility -->
    <supportedOS Id="{8e0f7a12-bfb3-4fe8-b9a5-48fd50a15a9a}" />
  </application>
</compatibility>
```

## Change the _app.config_ File
Open the _app.config file in your WinForms project and add the following code:
```<System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
  <add key="DpiAwareness" value="PerMonitorV2" />
</System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
```

## Run the Application
You will now see the improvements and compatibility on your monitor.

NOTE: We are still early in the process of fixing all bug improvements for High DPI compatibility. You may encounter some issues when dragging between screens of different resolutions and/or building on a computer that only supports a lower resolution.
