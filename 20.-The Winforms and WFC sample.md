## Hardware Requirements

Please be advised that we're running several containers all on the same box. 8Gb of memory could very likely not be enough. We recommend 16Gb.

## Software Requirements
 - Windows 10
 - Docker CE 
 - .NET Core 2.0 SDK
 - .NET Framework 4.7
 - (Optional) Visual Studio 2017 15.3.2 or later

NOTE: Docker only supports running on Windows 10, hence the requirement
