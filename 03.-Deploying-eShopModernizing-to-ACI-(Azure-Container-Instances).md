##  Overview
Deploying to a Docker host on a Windows Server 2016 VM in Azure allows you to have quick dev/test/staging environments where you can run your applications in a common place for testers or business users validating the app. VMs can also be valid for IaaS production environments.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This walkthrough shows you the main scenarios when deploying Windows Containers to Azure Container Instances (ACI) and how you can deploy eShopModernizing into ACI.

## Introduction to Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances makes it easy to create and manage Docker containers in Azure, without having to provision virtual machines or adopt a higher-level service. With ACI, you can directly deploy a Windows container in Azure and expose it to the internet with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a matter of seconds (Provided that you have the Windows Container image ready in a Docker registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry).
