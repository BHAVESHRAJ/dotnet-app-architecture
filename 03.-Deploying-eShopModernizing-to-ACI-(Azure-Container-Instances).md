##  Overview
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is the quickest way to have a Containers dev/test/staging environment where you can deploy single instances of containers.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This walkthrough shows you the main scenarios when deploying Windows Containers to Azure Container Instances (ACI) and how you can deploy eShopModernizing into ACI.

## Introduction to Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances makes it easy to create and manage Docker containers in Azure, without having to provision virtual machines or adopt a higher-level service. With ACI, you can directly deploy a Windows container in Azure and expose it to the internet with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a matter of seconds (Provided that you have the Windows Container image ready in a Docker registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry).

For further information on ACI, check the documentation here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/ 

##  Scenarios


## Create a resource group for eShopModernized and ACI
Azure container instances, like all Azure resources, must be placed in a resource group, a logical collection into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

You can create a resource group with the `az group create` command from the **Azure Cloud Shell** or the **Azure CLI**.

The following example creates a resource group named `eShopModernizedACI` in the `westus` datacenter in Azure.

`az group create --name eShopModernizedACI --location westus`
