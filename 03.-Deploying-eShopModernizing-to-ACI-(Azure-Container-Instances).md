##  Overview
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is the quickest way to have a Containers dev/test/staging environment where you can deploy single instances of containers.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This walkthrough shows you the main scenarios when deploying Windows Containers to Azure Container Instances (ACI) and how you can deploy eShopModernizing into ACI.

## Introduction to Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances makes it easy to create and manage Docker containers in Azure, without having to provision virtual machines or adopt a higher-level service. With ACI, you can directly deploy a Windows container in Azure and expose it to the internet with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in a matter of seconds (Provided that you have the Windows Container image ready in a Docker registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry).

For further information on ACI, check the documentation here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/ 

##  Scenarios
There can be variations about deploying the eShopModernizing apps into ACI such as deploying just one of the apps (MVC app, WebForms app or WCF service). In this global scenario shown below you can see the the apps deployed as containers plus the SQL Server container deployed into ACI (Azure Container Instances).

============ TBD ===============

## Use Azure Cloud Shell to run Azure CLI commands
The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the Azure CLI steps in this walkthrough. 
It has common Azure tools pre-installed and configured to use with your Azure account. 

The easiest way to launch the Azure Cloud Shell is by clicking on the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper right of the Azure portal, as shown in the image below:

## (Optional) Use Azure CLI from your local PC/Mac

Optionally, you can also use a local installation of the Azure CLI instead of Azure Cloud Shell. 
If you choose to install and use the Azure CLI locally, make sure you are using the latest version of Azure CLI, at least Azure CLI 2.0. 
Run `az --version` to find the version. 
If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a resource group for eShopModernized and ACI
Azure container instances, like all Azure resources, must be placed in a resource group, a logical collection into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

You can create a resource group with the `az group create` command from the **Azure Cloud Shell** or the **Azure CLI**.

The following example creates a resource group named `eShopModernizedACI` in the `westus` datacenter in Azure.

`az group create --name eShopModernizedACI --location westus`

## Create/Deploy the SQL Server container into ACI 

Note: In production environments, we recommend to migrate/use Azure SQL Database which provides High Availability and many more PaaS features. However, for a Dev/Test environment, you can deploy a SQL Server container into ACI, as in this example. 

You can create a container by providing a name, a Docker image, and an Azure resource group to the [az container create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/container#az_container_create) command. 
You can optionally expose the container to the internet by specifying a DNS name label.

Now, let's create your MSSQL container for the eShopModernizing apps with a command similar to the following:

`az container create --image microsoft/mssql-server-windows-developer --resource-group YoureShopModernizedACIResGroup --location westus --name your-mssql-windows-eshop-container-group --os-type Windows --cpu 3 --memory 3.5 --dns-name-label your-eshop-sql --ip-address public --ports 1433 --environment-variables ACCEPT_EULA=Y SA_PASSWORD=YourSQLPassword --verbose`

After a few seconds, the command's execution will respond with the container information, like in the following execution:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/38328528-01ad06ce-3800-11e8-94c4-d775eb1de47f.png)

It is important to note that you won't be able to use the container right away (that's why the initial state in the JSON response says **"provisioningState": "Creating"**) so you'll need to wait a few minutes until the SQL image is pulled into ACI. Then, it'll be ready to use.

You can check the state of the container/container-group with the command `az container show` like the following command:

`az container show --name your-mssql-windows-eshop-container-group --resource-group YoureShopModernizedACIResGroup`

The SQL container will be ready to use when you see the following in the response:
**"provisioningState": "Succeeded"**

It is also important to find out what's its final public IP and fully qualified DNS name that you can find as part of the JSON response:

      "ipAddress": {
        "additionalProperties": {},
        "dnsNameLabel": "your-eshop-sql",
        "fqdn": "your-eshop-sql.westus.azurecontainer.io",
        "ip": "25.91.35.39",
        "ports": [
          {
            "additionalProperties": {},
            "port": 1433,
            "protocol": "TCP"
          }
        ]
      },

To view the container's logs you can run the following command where you can see that SQL Server was correctly started:

`az container logs --resource-group YoureShopModernizedACIResGroup  --name your-mssql-windows-eshop-container-group`

At this point you should be able to see the SQL Server Windows Container in Azure's portal within your Azure Resource Manager resources, like here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/38335264-9eef63b6-3812-11e8-9d97-5f5bf598f846.png) 

Finally, you could even connect to the SQL Server container in ACI with [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms), as shown below:

Browse SQL Server in the container at ACI:

### Deleting the SQL container from ACI:
You can delete the SQL container from ACI with:

`az container delete --name your-mssql-windows-eshop-container-group --resource-group YoureShopModernizedACIResGroup`


--------- TBD ----------

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE FOR THE SQL CONTAINER:**
Note that in this sample SQL Server container to be deployed in ACI, you are publishing the SQL Server port (1433) on a public IP with a related public DNS name. This is okay for a test if you want to access the SQL Server container from [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) at your local dev machine, but for more permanent SQL Server deployments, you should not make the SQL Server container with public/Internet access, but only allowing internal access from Azure.


## Create/Deploy the ASP.NET MVC app container into ACI
This walkthrough explains the steps on how to deploy the ASP.NET MVC app container into ACI, but very similar steps could be performed for the ASP.NET Web Forms app container or the WCF Service container.

As mentioned, you can create a container by providing a name, a Docker image, and an Azure resource group to the [az container create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/container#az_container_create) command. 
You can optionally expose the container to the internet by specifying a DNS name label.

Now, let's create your ASP.NET MVC Windows Container from eShopModernizing with a command similar to the following:

TBD az container create ---------

After a few seconds, the command's execution will respond with the container information, like in the following execution:
