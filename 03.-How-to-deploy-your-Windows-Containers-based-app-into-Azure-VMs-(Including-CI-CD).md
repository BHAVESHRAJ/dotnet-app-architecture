##  Overview
Deploying Windows Containers to Azure VM will improve agility in your multiple staging environment because of the ready-to-run environments in Azure.
Although Windows Containers can be deployed into Windows VMs (Docker Hosts on Windows) either on-premises or in the cloud, like Azure, however, when deploying into Azure you get a much easier way to get started with ready-to-use Windows Server VMs for containers plus automatic scalability of VMs through Azure scale-sets.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This walkthrough shows you the multiple alternative you can have in order to dpeloy Windows Containers to Azure VMs based on Windows Server 2016 or later.
