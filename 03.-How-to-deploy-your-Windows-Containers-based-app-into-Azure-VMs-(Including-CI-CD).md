##  Overview
Deploying to a Docker host on a Windows Server 2016 VM in Azure allows you to have quick dev/test/staging environments where you can run your applications in a common place for testers or business users validating the app. VMs can also be valid for IaaS production environments.

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This walkthrough shows you the multiple alternatives you can have when deploying Windows Containers to Azure VMs based on Windows Server 2016 or later.

##  Scenarios
There are several scenarios. The following diagrams show you each of them to be detailed in this page.

## Prerequisites
- A Microsoft Azure subscription
- Dev machine with Windows 10, Docker for Windows and Visual Studio 2017


## Benefits when using Azure VM for Windows Containers Docker host
Although Windows Containers can be deployed into on-premises Windows Server 2016 VMs, however, when deploying into Azure you get a much easier way to get started with ready-to-use Windows Server Container VMs, a common place in the Internet accessible for testers plus automatic scalability of VMs through Azure scale-sets.
