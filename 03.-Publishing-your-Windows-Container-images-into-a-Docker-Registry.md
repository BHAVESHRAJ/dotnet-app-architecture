##  Overview
TBD

This walkthrough assumes a basic understanding of Docker. You can learn about Docker by reading the [Docker Overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/).

##  Goals for this walkthrough
This post describes how to create a custom eShopModernizedMVC Windows Container image (Docker image for Windows Containers) in your local development PC with Visual Studio and 'Docker for Windows' installed and then how to publish it into a Docker Registry. 

A Docker Registry is a public or private store which contains Docker container images, either for Linux or Windows.
An example od a Docker Registry is 'Docker Hub' and 'Azure Container Registry'. Both are public registries and both allow private repositories of images.
 
A few examples of a Docker registry and its related taxonomy is shown below.



You can also do the same action but in an automated way from your CI or build pipelines.

Publishing your custom Docker images in a Docker Registry requires a 2-step process:
1. Deploy a Service Fabric cluster into Azure (Or any other environment)
2. Deploy the application and related resources into the Service Fabric cluster

However, before trying this scenario deploying to an orchestrator, it is recommended that you:
1. Familiarize yourself with the previous sections about containerizing existing .NET Framework apps.
2. Youâ€™ve been testing the sample applications (eShopModernizedMVC and/or eShopModernizedWebForms) and running them on a local Docker for Windows dev machine.

##  Scenario

### Scenario A: Direct deployment to Service Fabric cluster from development environment
