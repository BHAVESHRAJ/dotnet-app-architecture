# Deploying eShopModernizedMVC to Kubernetes
1. Topic:
   * Sub-topic

This post describes how to deploy eShopModernizedMVC to Kubernetes but deploying the eShopModernizedWebForms should be pretty similar, so you can use almost the same procedure but using different deployment .yml files.
 
Deploying to Kubernetes from scratch a 2-step process:
- Deploy a K8s cluster
- Deploy the application and related resources

## Connect to Azure from PowerShell
1. Login to Azure with:

   `az login`

2.If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you whish to work with:

   `az account setÂ --subscription [my-azure-subscription-guid]`

3. Check your default subscription with:

   `az account show`

## Deploying the Kubernetes Cluster in Azure Container Service (ACS)

In order to deploy Windows Containers we need a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes instead of Linux. 
However, the Master node will be a Linux node.

Yo can find additional generic info on Kubernetes deployment into ACS in this post:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/kubernetes/container-service-kubernetes-windows-walkthrough

1. Create an Azure Resource Group to hold everything related to the Kubernetes cluster and delete everything in a single step whenever you need to.
   * Create a dedicated Resource group (of course, you can choose your own name for the Resource Group): 

   `az group create --name eShopK8sWinResGrp --location westus`

2. Create the Kubernetes cluster (you should use your own cluster name, user name and password):

   `az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group eShopK8sWinResGrp --name=eShopK8sWinCluster --agent-count=2 --generate-ssh-keys --windows --admin-username youruser --admin-password your@password`

If re-using already an created ssh key pair, you can add something like the following:

   `--ssh-key-value ~/acs/sshkeys/acscesar.pub \`

3. Install kubectl if you don't have it installed in your PC
To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your client computer, use kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line client.

If you're using Azure CloudShell, kubectl is already installed. 

If you want to install it locally, you can use the az acs kubernetes install-cli command.
The following Azure CLI example installs kubectl to your system. 
On Windows, run this command as an administrator:

   `az acs kubernetes install-cli`

4. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster and set the ssh key files to your local PC

   `az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=eShopK8sWinResGrp --name=eShopK8sWinCluster`

Again, if re-using an already created ssh key pair, you can add something like the following:

   `--ssh-key-value ~/acs/sshkeys/acscesar.pub \`

5. Check the connection to the cluster by retrieving nodes list: 

   `kubectl get nodes`
